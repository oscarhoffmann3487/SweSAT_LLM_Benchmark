As a chemist I worry about what is real and dependable in my field. I also care because all of this goes to the heart of an old, important – and unresolved – debate about how to regard scientific discoveries. There are two main camps in this debate: scientific realism and antirealism. Scientific realism holds that if science has made great progress by invoking entities such as electrons, then we should take the next step of accepting that they really do exist, that the world described by science is the “real” world. Our present theories are too _____ to have happened by chance: somehow we have latched onto the blueprint of the universe. This is not to everybody’s taste. Anti-realists accept the progress made by science but stop short of making the additional leap of _____ of believing in the materiality of things they cannot actually see. The anti-realist typically presents a counter-argument along these lines: so many past theories have come and gone, why should we ever regard any of them as real? Anti-realists also argue that their approach places them in a better position to _____ change when an established entity or theory becomes redundant. Not investing belief in a particular theory, they claim, allows them to move on to alternatives more easily. Realists retort such an approach is cavalier, or even dangerous.

Fully 78% of American women who have never been married say it is “very important” that their future spouse has a “steady job”. Wrenching changes in the labour market, combined with these _____ preferences, have shaken up the marriage market. Women are much more likely to have jobs than half a century ago; men, somewhat less so. Women today find it much easier to cope without a male breadwinner. At the same time, many find the pool of potential husbands less appealing. In 1960, young, never-married women were spoilt for choice. For every hundred of them aged 25–34, there were 139 young, never-married men vying for their _____ . In 2012 there were just 91. For some groups, the gap is much bigger. Young never-married black women outnumber young never-married black men with jobs by a startling two-to-one. This helps explain why, although African-Americans are more likely than other races to say they _____ marriage, only 26% of black women are actually married, compared with 51% of whites. The raw ratio of bachelors to bachelorettes varies with age. There are 118 unmarried 25-year-old men for every 100 single women, _____ women are more likely to marry older partners. Around the age of 40, the ratio is roughly even. From then on, the surplus of men turns into a deficit: by the age of 64, there are only 62 unmarried men, with or without jobs, for every 100 unmarried women. Pew predicts that, by 2030, 28% of American men – and 23% of women – will never have tied the knot. For men without much education, the picture is particularly grim. Among young American adults with a high school certificate or _____ , there are 174 never-married men for every 100 never-married women. The difference largely reflects the difficulty poorly-educated men have finding work.",
